# VanillaJavascriptProjects
This is my personal work of the freecodecamp youtube tutorial Javascript Projects

# Important note 
All the links used locally for images , CSS and JavaScript files are taken in the absolute form. I do know it is not a good practice . I had to because the browser fails to load the files when I use the relative links.
