# VanillaJavascriptProjects
This is my personal work of the freecodecamp youtube tutorial Javascript Projects

# Important note 
all the links used locally for images , css and javascript files are taken in the absolute form which I know it is not a best practice . I had to because the browser fails to load the files when I use the relative link
